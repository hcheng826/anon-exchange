# Anon NFT Exchange

An anonomyous NFT exchange based on Semaphore protocol.

## Mechanism

For the simplicity of the initial system, we make the NFT all traded at 0.1 ETH. It is possible to extend to other price tiers in the future.

### Semaphore groups

There are 2 Semaphore groups to achieve the anonymous of seller and buyer.

- Group1: Sellers whose NFT got sold
- Group2: Buyers who have deposited the ETH

### Seller

- List NFT

When seller lists the NFT on the exchange, a Semaphore identity is generated. Seller needs to note down the private Semaphore id. The smart contract will record the NFT with the corresponding public Semaphore id.

- Claim ETH

When the NFT is sold, the Semaphore id associated with that NFT is added to Group1. Seller who wants to claim the ETH will submit the proof generated by its private Semaphore id, anonymously proving that it's a member of the group and eligible to claim ETH. Smart contract will verify the proof, and signal the operation so it cannot be double claimed. Seller will also provide a fresh address to receive the ETH.

### Buyer

- Deposit ETH

Buyer needs to deposit ETH before it can buy NFT. When buyer deposits, a Semaphore id is generated. Buyer needs to note down the private id. The smart contract will add the public id into Group2.

- Buy NFT

Buyer submits the Semaphore proof that anonymously prove its membership of Group2. Smart contract will verify the proof and signal the operation to prevent double spending. Buyer will also provide a fresh address to receive the NFT.

### Being Anonymous

Note that transaction for buying NFT and claiming ETH can be sent from any address as long as the proof is valid. To remain anonymous the approach of this project is to maintain a relayer. The relayer will just submit the transaction for the user.
